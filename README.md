# Note-Taker-App

## Description
This project is an application to take notes. It will allow you to add and delete notes as needed. I created this application utilizing Express.js, the notes will store in a JSON file instead of in local storage. This application was difficult to work on since it was the first attempt at connecting the front end to back end services.
